## React Countdown Timer Exercise

![alt_text](./public/image.png) 

For this exercise, we would like you to build a simple countdown timer. You will need:
 * A "Start" button
 * A "Pause" button
 * A "Reset" button
 * An element to display the counter
 
The goal of this exercise is not to see if you can solve every problem but instead to see how you work through problems.

Ask as many clarifying questions as you need, and think out loud to help us understand your process.

### The requirements are as follows:
 * The timer starts at 30 seconds
 * The counter's display is in seconds, whole numbers only.
 * Clicking "Start" begins the countdown
    * If paused, the timer resumes
 * Clicking "Pause" button pauses the countdown
    * The value should not be reset
 * Clicking the "Reset" button sets the timer back to its initialized value (30 seconds)
    * If the timer is running, reset and continue counting down
    * If paused, reset and keep paused
 * When the countdown timer reaches 0, it should stop
    * Log "Timer Complete" to the console
